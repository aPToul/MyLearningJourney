# MyLearningJourney

This folder contains a few highlights of my learning journey with Machine Learning.

It includes:

1. Classification: a classifier I built to predict the topic of academic papers during my PaperScraper project; 

2. Clustering: A project which tracks my favourite topics over time through visualizing my browsing history.

3. TensorFlow: tutorials I completed on TF (ex: implementing K-means, SoM, AutoEncoders) and other projects which I re-implemented in TF.

4. Vector: a fun project where I map conversations into an embedding using Word2Vec. This allows me to visualize conversation trajectories and build automatic mind maps.
